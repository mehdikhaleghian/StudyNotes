Azure Functions 2
-------------------------------
Serverless
*Azure functions (serverless compute)
is an evolution of azure webjobs sdk
event + code
*Logic Apps (serverless workflows)
this helps you to chain different functions together
*Event Grid (serverless event routing)
when an event happens you need to route that event to all the pieces that execute

What make up a serverless technology:
Helps you develop and deply applications faster because you are not worried about managing servers
*Reduced devops
*Reduced time to market
because you are just worried about the core logic of your application
*Per action billing
if nothing is ever running you are not paying anything
