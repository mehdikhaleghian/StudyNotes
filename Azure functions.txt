serverless architectures in azure
Hosting plan:dynamic and app service plan
--------------------
learn more about azure function security???


which senarios are good fit for azure functions?
Why should I use azure functions?
it seems that azure functions bring the topic of serverless code
------------------------------------------
Azure Functions = Events + Code
------------------------------------------
type of events{
	time-based,// this is like background processes, the question is how long it can run for?
	//are they good for generating reports?
	new data become available",//a new item in the queue or a new file in azure blob storage
	webHooks,// you can write your own webHooks
	
}

//cost is based on how long your function runs and what the memory usage of the function is
//azure functions are totally appropriate when you run your job less often
//why you have to pay the cost of an app service plan when you can go cheaper
//the question is are they really good for long running background process?
//the threshold of a running function is 5 minutes
//we can group related azure functions into a function app
//interesting slack requires a webhook to call when for example deployment is done so it can call a funcion which responds to web hooks
